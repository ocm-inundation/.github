# NOAA OCM Inundation Organization

The NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) Inundation Organization is committed to enhancing our understanding and response to various types of inundation events, including floods, sea level rise, and tsunamis. Our projects include the Flood Exposure Mapper, Sea Level Calculator, Stormwater Floods, Lake Level Viewer, NOAA Tsunami Aware, and Sea Level Rise applications. By leveraging advanced technology, comprehensive data, and scientific research, we develop tools and applications that provide accurate and timely information to support disaster preparedness and response efforts across multiple sectors.

## NOAA OCM Inundation Organization Projects

Below is a list of the associated projects for the NOAA OCM Inundation Organization. More information on the repositories can be found in the README files of each page.

### [Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper](https://github.com/ocm-inundation/floodexposure)

The NOAA Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper application supports community assessments of coastal hazard risks by generating maps that highlight exposed people, places, and resources. This tool facilitates sharing, downloading, and using these maps for stakeholder engagement across the East Coast, West Coast, Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes and Pacific and Caribbean Islands.

### [Lake Level Viewer](https://github.com/ocm-inundation/llv_v3)

The NOAA Lake Level Viewer is a web application for visualizing potential lake level changes and their impacts. It aids researchers, environmentalists, policymakers, and the public in understanding the implications of fluctuating lake levels on ecosystems, communities, and infrastructure.
