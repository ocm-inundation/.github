# NOAA OCM Inundation Organization

The NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) Inundation Organization is committed to enhancing our understanding and response to various types of inundation events, including floods, sea level rise, and tsunamis. Our projects include the Flood Exposure Mapper, Sea Level Calculator, Stormwater Floods, Lake Level Viewer, NOAA Tsunami Aware, and Sea Level Rise applications. By leveraging advanced technology, comprehensive data, and scientific research, we develop tools and applications that provide accurate and timely information to support disaster preparedness and response efforts across multiple sectors.

### [Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper](https://github.com/ocm-inundation/floodexposure)

NOAA's Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper application supports community assessments of coastal hazard risks by generating maps that highlight exposed people, places, and resources. This tool facilitates sharing, downloading, and using these maps for stakeholder engagement across the East Coast, West Coast, Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes and Pacific and Caribbean Islands.
